# Alec-Workshop
This is where I'm going to put all of the Alec Workshop raw files at.
I have a google website on my profile, or you can copy with link --> https://sites.google.com/view/alecworkshop/home
Right now I know a lot of Lua, and a little bit of Python and C#. Currently I'm learning Java, im new so if the code looks bad then you know why.
If you have any tips or comments you would like to share then please do so.
Due to the way that Google Sites work I have to put the code all into 1 html file thats why each project has many files
I make the project using 1 HTML and whatever amount of Java files I need, then I smush it all into 1 HTML file so people don't have to download the files.
You can run either HTML file, they both should work.
I don't care what you do with these files im just sharing my work.
